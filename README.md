A package to create files, folders and content with variables.

[PHP Class](https://github.com/dillingham/stubs#usage) | [Standalone CLI](https://github.com/dillingham/stubs#command-line-interface) | [Laravel Support](https://github.com/dillingham/stubs#laravel-support)

### Installation

```
composer require dillingham/stubs
```
or install globally to use the cli:
```
composer global require dillingham/stubs
```

### Variables

Variables are declared as an associative array.

The `key` is referenced in the file paths and contents between brackets, as `{{key}}`.

```php
[
    'name' => 'User',
    'plural' => 'Users',
    'lower' => 'user',
]
```

becomes `{{name}}` `{{plural}}` `{{lower}}`.

### Variable Placement

Variables can be in filepaths, filenames & in the content

```
/views/{{name}}/index.blade.php
```
```
<buton>Create {{name}}</button>
```

For a basic example, [click here](https://github.com/dillingham/stubs/tree/master/tests/stubs)

### Usage

Simply declare the source and output and which variables to render.
```php
use Stub\Stub;
```
#### Process a folder & output files to another folder:
```php
(new Stub)
    ->source('stubs/stub-1')
    ->output('project-name')
    ->render($variables);
```

#### Process a folder and send the files to a callback:
```php
(new Stub)
    ->source('stubs/stub-2')
    ->output(function($path, $content) {
        // called for each renderd file
    })->render($variables);
```
You must handle/store file(s) yourself in the callback.

#### Convert existing files into stubs for future use:
```php
(new Stub)
    ->source('project')
    ->output('stubs/stub-name')
    ->create([
        'Users' => 'name',
        'user' => 'lower'
    ]);
```

- Renders all files & folders in `project`
- Replaces `Users` with `{{name}}`
- Replaces `user` with `{{lower}}`

## Command Line Interface

Perform the same behavior described above from the command line

---
Composer install this package globally:

```bash
composer global require dillingham/stubs
```

You can pass variables to `stubs` like so:

```bash
stub render ./source ./output key:value key:"value with spaces"
```

For many or more complex variable sets, pass a json file path:

```bash
stub render ./source ./output values.json
```

Example of the json file content:

```json
{
    "name": "Brian Dillingham",
    "email": "brian@dillingham.dev",
    "title": "Programmer"
}
```

---

## Laravel Support

Use artisan commands & facades along with methods demonstrated above

---

#### Artisan
```bash
php artisan stub:render ./stubs ./project vars.json
```
```bash
php artisan stub:create ./project ./stubs vars.json
```

#### Facade

```php
Stub::source(resource_path('stubs'))
    ->output(resource_path('Models'))
    ->render($variables);
```
```php
Stub::source(app_path())
    ->output(resource_path('stubs'))
    ->create($variables);
```
